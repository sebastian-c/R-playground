Subsetting
========================================================

**Some hints:**

*Functions to look up (Technically,* `women` *is a default dataset in R)*
```
?seq
?"["
?women
```
```{r}
seq(from=1, to=10, by=2)
```
```{r women-examples}
#Show the dataframe `women` that comes with R
women
#Show the first row of women
women[1, ]
#Show the first column of women
women[, 1]
#Show the column of women titled "height"
women[,"height"]
#Get the 2nd, 3rd and 7th rows
women[c(2,3,7),]
#How many rows and columns does the data have?
nrow(women)
ncol(women)
```

<big>**Your mission**</big>
Take this dataframe:
```{r sample-data}
dat <- data.frame(a=c(1,2,4,5,2), b=c(3,5,7,34,3), c=c(7,2,3,6,7))
dat
```
And get every odd-numbered row of the third column:
```{r subset-solution, echo=FALSE}
dat[seq(1,nrow(dat),2), 3]
